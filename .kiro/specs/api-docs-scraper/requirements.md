# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated API documentation scraper that extracts all API documentation from https://api.chatfire.cn/docs and stores it locally in markdown format. The documentation will be organized by categories in a local docs directory structure for easy reference and offline access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scrape all API documentation from a website, so that I can have offline access to the complete API reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper is executed THEN the system SHALL fetch all API documentation from https://api.chatfire.cn/docs
2. WHEN documentation is retrieved THEN the system SHALL convert it to markdown format
3. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all essential information including endpoints, parameters, examples, and descriptions
4. IF the source website is unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scraped documentation organized by categories, so that I can easily navigate and find specific API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is processed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and create category-based directory structure
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL group related API endpoints together based on their functionality or service area
3. WHEN creating directories THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive names for each category
4. IF categories cannot be automatically detected THEN the system SHALL create a logical fallback organization structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scraped documentation stored in the local docs directory, so that it integrates with my existing project documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping is initiated THEN the system SHALL create or use the existing docs directory in the current project
2. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL maintain a clean directory structure within docs/
3. WHEN files are created THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames that reflect the API endpoint or section
4. IF the docs directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scraper to handle different types of API documentation formats, so that all information is captured accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documentation THEN the system SHALL handle HTML content and convert it to clean markdown
2. WHEN encountering code examples THEN the system SHALL preserve syntax highlighting information and formatting
3. WHEN processing tables THEN the system SHALL convert them to proper markdown table format
4. WHEN handling images or diagrams THEN the system SHALL either download them locally or preserve their references
5. IF special formatting is encountered THEN the system SHALL attempt to preserve it in markdown equivalent format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scraper to be configurable and reusable, so that I can use it for other API documentation sites in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the scraper THEN the system SHALL allow specification of target URL and output directory
2. WHEN running the scraper THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and logging
3. WHEN scraping is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was scraped and where it was stored
4. IF errors occur during scraping THEN the system SHALL log them clearly and continue with remaining content where possible
